# Quantum Information

**Regarding the current health situation, keep track of the [university](https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/Coronavirus.html) and [cantonal](https://www.coronavirus.bs.ch/) guidelines. Lectures will be distributed online until further notice. Information will be sent by email.**

[Course at the University of Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/home?id=239410), given by James Wootton of IBM Research.

The course begins on 19th Feb 2020 and will have weekly lectures and exercises. If you are not able to attend the course in person, you can follow along with the materials below.


## Course Content

Quantum information theory is the basis of multiple emerging technologies, such as quantum computation and quantum crypotography. It allows us to understand how quantum effects in physical systems may be harnessed for new forms of information processing. The course will also feature some hands on experience with quantum technology, via the open-source Qiskit framework for quantum computing;

## Course Text

The course will be based on the [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html).

## Lectures

* Lecture 1: Based on [The atoms of computation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-states/atoms-computation.ipynb) and [The unique properties of qubits](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-states/unique-properties-qubits.ipynb).

* Lecture 2: This is not a course on Python and Qiskit, though we will be using them. So in this lecture we'll review [Python and Jupyter Notebooks](qiskit-textbook/content/ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.ipynb) and [Qiskit](qiskit-textbook/content/ch-prerequisites/qiskit.ipynb). You'll need to run these notebooks. See the information in 'Exercises' for more information on this.

* Lecture 3: Based on [Writing Down Qubit States](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-states/writing-down-qubit-states.ipynb) and [Pauli Matrices and the Bloch Sphere](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-states/pauli-matrices-bloch-sphere.ipynb).

* Lecture 4: Based on [States for Many Qubits](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-states/states-many-qubits.ipynb), [Quantum Gates](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-gates/quantum-gates.ipynb) and [Fun with Matrices](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-gates/fun-matrices.ipynb).

* Lecture 5: Based on [Standard Gate Set](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-gates/standard-gate-set.ipynb) and [Proving Universality](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-gates/proving-universality.ipynb).

* Lecture 6: Based on [Basic Circuit Identities](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-gates/basic-circuit-identities.ipynb).

* Lecture 7: Based on [Superdense Coding](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-algorithms/superdense-coding.ipynb) and [Quantum Teleportation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-algorithms/teleportation.ipynb).

* Lecture 8: Based on [Classical Computation on a Quantum Computer](extra/Oracle-Intro.pdf) and [Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/blob/master/qiskit-textbook/content/ch-algorithms/bernstein-vazirani.ipynb)

## Exercises

Some exercises will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These can be run locally by installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). They can also be run online without any installation using the [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jupyter/). For this, just use the 'import' function.

The easiest way to to download the exercises is to download the whole repository using [this link](https://github.com/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/archive/master.zip).

* **Exercise 1** Work through [this notebook](exercises/Hello_Qiskit.ipynb). Note that [this file](exercises/hello_quantum.py) needs to be located in the same directory. If using the IBM Quantum Experience, simply upload both. Hand in the completed notebook by email.

* **Exercise 2** Use quantum gates to make classical logic gates in [this notebook](exercises/classical_logic_gates.ipynb).

* **Exercise 3** [Try out your linear algebra](exercises/exercise_3.pdf).

* **Exercise 4** [Get to know your Paulis](exercises/exercise_4.pdf).

* **Exercise 5** [Using Clifford gates](exercises/exercise_5.pdf).

* **Exercise 6** [Simulate a simple Hamiltonian](exercises/exercise_6.ipynb).

* **Exercise 7** [Beam a qubit up, Scotty!](exercises/exercise_7.pdf)


### Bonus exercises

These won't be graded, but they will help you out.

* **Python and Qiskit on PewPews** Using a PewPew you can experiment with Python and Qiskit in a simple and fun environment. You can even try making a game! See the guide [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit/blob/master/versions/MicroPython/tutorials/index.ipynb) to get started. You can either use a physical PewPew (handed out in lecture), or an emulator.


## Exam

~~The final exam is planned for the week of 25th May. Most likely at 14:00 on 27th May. Let me know of any sheduling conflicts.~~

We'll see what we can do closer to the time.
